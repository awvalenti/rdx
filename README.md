# History
Originally, this repository hosted a project whose goal was to develop an
offline web chess clock application that worked on iPod Touch with iOS 6.
Unfortunately, due to a restriction (and misbehavior) on sound capabilities
of Safari, this project ended up being non-viable and was discontinued.
