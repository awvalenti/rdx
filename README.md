# Teaching Chess Board
An offline tool to create, view, save and load chess
board positions, made with pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Unicode.

Code is condensed on a single HTML file for some reasons:
- Easy distribution
- Zero project setup
- Code is small enough

# How to run...

## ...from the internet
Just access
[https://awvalenti.github.io/teaching-chess-board](https://awvalenti.github.io/teaching-chess-board).

## ...from your computer
Download `index.html` by right-clicking
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awvalenti/teaching-chess-board/master/index.html),
choose **"Save link as"** or similar, save it on your computer
and open it on your web browser.

If you have any problems, try downloading `index.html` file
from some [releases](older release).

# Commands
Mouse: left-click inserts a piece. Middle or right-click removes it.

Keyboard: keys 0-9 insert pieces (they will make sense on the numeric
keypad). Delete or NumPad dot removes them.

# To be done
- Adapt dynamically to different screen sizes (currently, we need to
  zoom in or out until a good fit is reached)
- Better how-to-use explanation
- Validation of chess positions
- Possibility to export to PGN
- Much more stuff!
